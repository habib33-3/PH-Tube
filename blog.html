              The var, let and const are the keywords used in javascript for
              declaring variables. Each has its scope and uses
            </p>

            <p>
              Var: The "var" keyword declares a function-scoped variable. As a
              result, it can only be accessed within the function in which it
              was declared. It is inaccessible from outside the function. Before
              initialization, this variable can be accessed, but its default
              value would be "undefined."
            </p>

            <p>
              Let: The "let" keyword in JavaScript defines the scope of a
              variable. In JavaScript, a block is represented by curly braces,
              and it's important to note that each function or loop creates its
              own block scope. Using the `let` keyword restricts access to the
              variable within its respective block. Additionally, attempting to
              access these variables before initialization results in a
              reference error.
            </p>

            <p>
              Const: The scope of a variable defined using the "let" keyword and
              the "const" keyword is the same. However, unlike "let," these
              variables cannot be modified once they are assigned a value.

              In JavaScript, 'null' represents the deliberate absence of an
              object or data. It serves various purposes, such as initializing
              variables, indicating errors or missing values in functions,
              setting default parameters, clearing object properties, checking
              for the presence of a value, acting as special markers in arrays,
              removing event listeners, and acting as a temporary placeholder
              when a meaningful value is absent in the code. Essentially, it
              signifies that something lacks significance in the current context
              of the program.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, in JavaScript, "undefined" signifies the
              absence or lack of a defined value. It typically occurs when
              variables are empty, function parameters are missing, or
              properties within objects are non-existent. Developers also use it
              to clear values and confirm the existence of variables.
              Essentially, "undefined" is a versatile JavaScript term used to
              handle situations involving missing or non-existent values.

            What do you mean by REST API?

              A REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer
              Application Programming Interface, is an approach to designing web
              services that emphasizes simplicity, scalability, and the
              utilization of standard HTTP protocols and URIs to interact with
              resources. RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning that every request
              carries all necessary information, making them well-suited for
              distributed systems. They employ a uniform interface and a
              resource-oriented structure, enabling clients to perform Create,
              Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on these resources. Due
              to its flexibility and compatibility with the HTTP protocol, REST
              has gained significant popularity as a preferred choice for
              constructing online APIs.
