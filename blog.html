            Discuss the scope of var, let, and const.

              The var, let and const are the keywords used in javascript for
              declaring variables. Each has its scope and uses
            </p>

            <p>
              Var: The "var" keyword declares a function-scoped variable. As a
              result, it can only be accessed within the function in which it
              was declared. It is inaccessible from outside the function. Before
              initialization, this variable can be accessed, but its default
              value would be "undefined."
            </p>

            <p>
              Let: The "let" keyword in JavaScript defines the scope of a
              variable. In JavaScript, a block is represented by curly braces,
              and it's important to note that each function or loop creates its
              own block scope. Using the `let` keyword restricts access to the
              variable within its respective block. Additionally, attempting to
              access these variables before initialization results in a
              reference error.
            </p>

            <p>
              Const: The scope of a variable defined using the "let" keyword and
              the "const" keyword is the same. However, unlike "let," these
              variables cannot be modified once they are assigned a value.

              In JavaScript, 'null' signifies the intentional absence of object
              or data. It's used for various purposes, like initializing
              variables, indicating errors or missing values in functions,
              setting default parameters, clearing object properties, checking
              for value presence, acting as special array markers, removing
              event listeners, and serving as a temporary placeholder when a
              meaningful value is absent in your code. Essentially, it expresses
              that something lacks significance in your program's current
              context.
            </p>
            <p>
              In JavaScript, "undefined" signifies the absence or lack of a
              defined value. It commonly appears when variables are empty,
              function parameters are removed, or properties within objects do
              not exist. Developers also use it to clear values and verify
              variable existence. Essentially, "undefined" is a versatile
              JavaScript term for handling missing or non-existent values.

            What do you mean by REST API?

            <p>
              A REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer
              Application Programming Interface, is an approach to designing web
              services that emphasizes simplicity, scalability, and the
              utilization of standard HTTP protocols and URIs to interact with
              resources. RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning that every request
              carries all necessary information, making them well-suited for
              distributed systems. They employ a uniform interface and a
              resource-oriented structure, enabling clients to perform Create,
              Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on these resources. Due
              to its flexibility and compatibility with the HTTP protocol, REST
              has gained significant popularity as a preferred choice for
              constructing online APIs.
